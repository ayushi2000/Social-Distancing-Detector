# Social Distancing Detector
Social distancing has taken the world by a storm. In this era of the pandemic, it has become a new normal for all of us. Around the globe, people are devastated by the spread of the novel COVID-19. In the absence of any medical treatment, social distancing is advised to be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive measures by humans to avoid the virus.

The Social Distancing Detector will identify people not maintaining a safe distance of a feet or 3 meters (as suggested by the World Health Organization). It uses different machine learning and computer vision concepts. It can assist authorities to maintain physical distancing necessary in public places.

It uses OpenCV and YOLO v3 and requires videos to test the proposed system on.
